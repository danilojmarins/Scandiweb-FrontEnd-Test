# Scandiweb Test Assignment - Frontend

This project was created for the Scandiweb Junior Developer Test Assignment.

This repository stands for the Frontend part of the project, which was created with ReactJS, using the command:

```
npx create react-app
```

For the stylization, it was used the CSS extension language: SASS.

The API calls were made using Fetch, Axios and Ky, because of problems involving the platform which the backend was hosted.
